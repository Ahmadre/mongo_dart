#Mongo-dart - MongoDB driver for Dart programming language.

It is server-side library with minimalistic support of MongoDb. At the moment supported basic CRUD operations.

Some samples are in directory **examples**. Also Chris Buckett gave a realistic use case scenario in two part blog post:

 - [Building a client / server Dart App – Part 1 – server side](http://dartwatch.com/index.php/2012/03/building-a-client-server-dart-app-part-1-server-side/)
 - [Building a client / server Dart App – Part 2 – client (browser) side](http://dartwatch.com/index.php/2012/03/building-clientserver-app-part2/)
